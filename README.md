The busy beaver game is a theoretical computer science challenge about finding a program that produces the most non-zeros output and runs the longest before it terminates.

The program that is used to play the game is a n-state Turing Machine. The challenge is to conceived a transition functions in order to get either the highest score (no. of non zeros output) or the maximum number of steps before the program eventually halts.
